          Hidase Telecom, a local telecom products and services distributor,
          started the construction of a mixed-use headquarters and business
          complex for an estimated half a billion Birr investment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The headquarters, which will be built in the Hayahulet area will have
          19 floors and four basement levels. To rest on 1,500Sqm of land, the
          building is planned to be completed within three years.
        </p>
        <p
          >Anchor Foundation Specialist Plc, a local firm specialised in
          foundation works, started the construction of the shoring in November.
          Anchor, which is known for building the United and Nib bank
          headquarters, Marriot International Hotel and the Addis Abeba Light
          Railway Transit Qality Terminal, is expected to complete the shoring
          this month.
        </p>
        <p>
          BKW Consulting Architects, Planners & Engineers Plc, another local
          firm that has been in business since 2003, is involved in
          architectural and engineering activities and is also supervising the
          project. The contractor for the structural part is expected to be
          hired soon, since the company floated a tender calling for interested
          companies.
        </p>
        <p
          >Established with an initial capital of 200,000 Br and 2,508
          shareholders, Hidase currently has 4,500 employees and declared 497
          million Br in revenues and 52 million Br in net profit in 2019. It
          engages with the distribution of mobile prepaid cards, SIM cards, bill
          collection, vehicle maintenance and sales of mobile phones and
          parts.</p
        >

        <p
          >Aimed at minimising the rental cost the company spent by constructing
          its own headquarters, the management plans to secure a loan for the
          finishing works of the building, according to Gosaye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hidasie Telecom, which spends eight million Birr annually on rent,
          plans to finance the structural works from its own balance sheet.
